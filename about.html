            <summary>Mission & Objectives</summary>
            <span><p>The Jammu Genocide Collective is an independent collective dedicated to the study, research, awareness and rememberance of the Jammu genocide that happened in 1947.</p>
            <p>One of the main objectives of Jammu Genocide collective is to highlight the events that occured in 1947 under the Dogra state in J&K. The events that occurred in Jammu in 1947 were a genocide as it gains its conceptual horror precisely because of the exterminated nature of the Holocaust. Hitler wanted the Jews exterminated, wiped out from existence, not just driven out. The same is the case in the Jammu Genocide, the Dogra ruler Hari Singh wanted the Muslims of Jammu exterminated, he saw it to be the final solution of his political will.</p> <p>Large scale crimes which involve the ethnic cleansing and killing of a certain group of people cannot be forgotten.
            Such events should be acknowledged and accepted by the world, there is a need to talk about these events so we can learn from them and recognize the need to do everything in our power to prevent such horrific events from ever occuring again. We also cannot ignore the reality of certain elements that still exist today in the region of south asia and particulary within India's geo-political boundaries.  </p></span>
