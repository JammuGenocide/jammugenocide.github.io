        <a href="">&nbsp Genocide Overview </a><br><br><br>

        <p>
            <b>T</b>he Jammu <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/genocide-prevention/learn-about-genocide-and-other-mass-atrocities/what-is-genocide">
                 genocide</a> refers to the killings of Jammu Muslim people living in the Dogra State
             of Jammu & Kashmir from October 1947 through November 1947. At least 200,000 and possibly 
             as many as 250,000 died during the genocide, either in massacres and individual killings,
              or after kidnapping and illness in refugee camps.
        </p>

        <p>
        Dogra authorities, supported by auxiliary troops and at times by civilians, perpetrated most of
         the persecution and mass killing. The Dogra State, run by Hari Singh aimed to solidify Hindu 
         dominance in the regions of Jammu by eliminating the sizeable Muslim presence there.
        </p>

            <p> Mass atrocities, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide are often perpetrated within
                the context of war or some other major event. The killings of Jammu Muslims was closely linked
                 to the events of <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/1947-partition/about/1947-partition-of-india-pakistan">
                  1947 partition</a>. Fearing that the Dogra rule would come to an end after the
                  successful uprising in Poonch, in mid 1947 the Dogra government began the training, funding,
                   planning and propoganda against Muslim population in Jammu province. In the months that
                    followed, the Dogra army along with Hindu extremists would kill over 200,000 Muslims in Jammu,
                     further deporting another 200,000 Muslims to the neighboring Pakistan and newly created state 
                     of Azad Jammu & Kashmir.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        The victims of the Jammu genocide include people killed in local massacres that began in
         October 1937; others who died during deportations in refugee camps, under conditions of, 
         dehydration, exposure, and disease; and Muslims who died in or en route to the regions of
          the Pubjab, Pakistan. In addition, tens of thousands of Jammu women & children were kidnapped.
        </p>

        <p>
         Gandhi commented on the situation in Jammu on 25 December 1947 in his speech in New Delhi:
<pre><i>
"The Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu and those who had gone 
there from outside killed Muslims. 
The Maharaja of Kashmir is responsible for what is happening thereâ€¦
A large number of Muslims have been killed there and Muslim women have
been dishonored."</i>
</pre>
