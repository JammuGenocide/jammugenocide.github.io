                <p>The atrocities committed against the Jammu Muslims under Dogra ruler Hari Singh's rule in Jammu & Kashmir are called as Jammu Genocide. <br> <br> <b>The U.N convention</b> of 1948 defines genocide as, "Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, an ethnic, racial or religious group." <br><br> <b>The U.N Commission</b> of experts defines ethnic cleansing as, "Rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove from a given area person of another ethnic group or religious group. <br><br> The events that occurred in Jammu in 1947 were a genocide as it gains its conceptual horror precisely because of the exterminated nature of the Holocaust. Hitler wanted the Jews exterminated, not just driven out. The same is the case in the Jammu Genocide, the Dogra ruler Hari Singh wanted the Muslims of Jammu exterminated, he saw it to be the final solution of his political policy. During the genocide, Dogra ruler Hari Singh, along with wanting to completely exterminate Muslims, also sponsored ethnic cleansing in Jammu. <br><br>The Mass murders in Jammu between Oct-Nov 1947 were calculated, planned and targeted, with intent to destroy the Muslim population.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>The decision to carry out a genocide against the Jammu Muslims was made by the Dogra ruler [Hari Singh], his ministers, and advisors. These killings were orchestrated with the support of the RSS all over Jammu. Notable people that were responsible for the events besides Dogra ruler are his
                his wife <b>Tara Singh</b>, Governor Chet Ram Chopra, DIG Police Bakhsi Udhay Chand and <b>Prem Nath Dogra</b>.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Initial official reported numbers by <b>The Civil & Military Gazette</b> on December 18, 1947, was around 70K. <b>The London Times</b> reported 237K on August 10, 1948. It is estimated that approx. 250K+ Muslims perished between Oct-Nov 1947. Entire villages, towns and neighborhood's were wiped out from their Muslim population. After the genocide took place the incumbent govt. who also named the Dogra Ruler as its monarch did all it could to destroy evidence of the massacre and suppress any information regarding the genocide that took place. </p>

                <p>There were many witnesses to the Jammu Genocide.
