          <div class="tab">
            <h1>Carnage in Kathua</h1>
            <p>
              There were also several Army officers of lesser rank. Before the Maharaja's arrival,
              a convoy of Muslim refugees which had come from the interior of Kathua and
              had swelled into numbers while advancing towards the borders reached
              there. The army compelled them to pass through the Hindu mob; on reaching
              there, one of the officers ordered the mob to "send them to Pakistan". Upon
              this, the Dogra soldiers and armed goondas attacked them amidst the Dogra
              war cry of 'Maharaja Bahadur Ki Jail. It is claimed that not many were able to
              escape alive. On the next day, the Maharaja and the Prime Minister visited
              the town and congratulated their followers for their "performance". Another
              convoy of nearly twelve thousand Muslims left Kathua for Pakistan after their
              failure to secure protection. Two miles from Pakistan border at village
              Khasyal a mob comprising Dogra soldiers and Sanghis fell upon them with
              rifles and swords. Similarly, a convoy of two thousand Muslims which left
              village Bandore was attacked at Chhati Khoi, about three miles from the
              Pakistan border. A convoy of about 7000 Muslims left Chani Rodoon for
              Pakistan; it was attacked at Heera Nagar. <br><br>
              
              A convoy of 500 Muslims left Kohatah, none of whom is claimed to have been able 
              to enter Pakistan. A convoy of 3000 Muslims from Budhi and Tala Mola which left for Pakistan,
              was attacked at Mahi Chak. A convoy of about six thousand Muslims left
              Nagri, Runb and Chhatta villages for Pakistan, but was attacked at
              Khikhiyan. Muslims from villages Sallni, Hiranagar, Candi etc. gathered at
              Hiranagar and left for Pakistan. They were stopped by the army at some
              distance and told to hand over their cash and ornaments in exchange for a
              guarantee to be escorted to Pakistan borders. After receiving a large number
              of ornaments and cash, the convoy was allowed to proceed and an escort
              was also provided, but when they reached Chhati Khoi, a soldier opened fire
              and instantly Sanghis who had already taken positions before their arrival as
              they seemed to have been briefed in advance, attacked the convoy. These
              goondas also had a brengun. A convoy of two thousand Muslims from
              Rajpura and Kagowal left for Pakistan, but was attacked in the way. In
              Samba town, about ten thousand Muslims from the town and its suburbs
              collected for migration to Pakistan. Most of the male were invited to the town-
              pond on the pretext of forming a Peace Committee, but there they were
              surrounded by armed bands and in their absence, young girls from their
              homes were abducted. There is no doubt that a large number of Muslims,
              men, women and children were killed each time.</p>

            <p>This place is 25 miles from Udhampur and its boundaries meet
              Sambha and Kathua tehsils; the depredations were started in the Paimasta
              illaqa. Th. Chander Uhdey Singh was appointed tehsildar and Darshan Singh
              Sub Inspector put in charge of thana. Rugnath Singh, Retd. tehsildar was
              permanently staying thereto direct the activities of the Sangh in collaboration
              with MankameshwarVakil and Ram Chand Shah. Twice they made false
              reports that thousands of Muslims were collecting in the illaqa and that
              breach of peace was apprehended. They also made false reports against the
              Basantgarh Muslims. The tehsildar being related to the Maharani proudly
              informed her that not a sin$le Muslim could now be found in his illaqa.
              
              
              Thakar Dhaneter Singh, M.L.A. formed a gang and advanced towards
              Bhadarwah but did not succeed in this area although he was responsible for
              the murder of a large number of Muslims in the Ramnagar tehsil. The Raja of
              Ramkot was specially summoned to Jammu and given instructions to start
              genocide in his illaqa.</p>

            <h1>Massacres of Sambha</h1>
            <p>  <b>Early October 1947:</b><br> About 14,000 Muslims living in Sambha were besieged by 
              armed Hindus and Sikhs, who cut off the rations and watersupply of the villages. </p>
              
              <p><b>On October 23:</b><br> Sambha
              village was visited by His Highness the Maharaja himself, and almost immediately after his visit, all the
              Muslim women in the village were taken away by State troops, and the men were slaughtered with the exception
              of fifteen survivors, who escaped to Sialkot. About eight thousand Muslims assembled at the Bulla Tank near 
              Kathua on October 20, after their request for protection had been ignored by the sub-divisional magistrate of
              Kathua. </p>
              
              <p>After marching three miles towards the Pakistan border, they were encircled by Dogra troops and armed 
              Sikh civilians, and all of them were slaughtered with the exception of forty persons, who managed to escape to
              Sialkot.</p>


              <h5><b>The words of the Second master of the Samba High School who was one of the passengers:</b></h4>

              <P> <b style="font-size: 20px;">"</b>Among them were my old parents, three brothers, two sons and two
                daughters. The trucks started at 2 p.m. At Satwari Cantonment we
                found Hindus and Sikhs assembled on both sides of the road and
                armed to the teeth. Muslims got extremely worried and each one of
                us thought that we were no longer safe. Some youth tried to save
                themselves by jumping down from the trucks but where could they
                go? They were killed on the spot. The drivers then diverted the
                trucks towards Kathua road and accelerated the speed. It was time
                for evening prayers when four trucks were stopped near the town of
                Samba. As soon as we came down, we were surrounded and taken
                to a ground where we were made to sit. First of all, women were
                separated from us. On two sides of the ground stood a hill, on the
                third side were the trucks, while only one side was open, but on this
                side we found soldiers with fixed machine-guns; so there was no
                side left for us to run away. The assailants had been divided into six
                or seven groups. </P>

                <p>
                Those who had surrounded us were armed with rifles, spears,
                swords and birchas. Those who snatched away ornaments, money,
                beddings and other property, consisted mostly of Ahhuts; a third
                group was taking possession of women and in overall charge were
                officers who issued orders. The Satanic arrangements were so
                complete and the workers so trained which left no doubt that they
                had been trained over a considerable period of time. The victims
                were then removed to the butchery in a group of six persons each. I
                put off my shoes and ran away and though fired at, was able to save
                my life but my old parents, brothers, sons and daughters who had
                boarded the trucks with myself, I have not heard of them since
                then.<b style="font-size: 20px;">"</b></P>

              the vicinity of the town and were led towards the Akhnoor bridge where Dogra soldiers opened fire killing a large number. 
              It is claimed that the killing was so extensive that blood actually flowed on the bridge. On the same day, several attacks 
              were launched on Muslims in Kathua district resulting in considerable deaths. According to the Civil & Military Gazette,
              women & children were not separated they were also killed, only 100 survived.</p>

            <h1>The massacres in the City</h1>
            <p>Here is a factual report jointly submitted by two foreigners who visited the subcontinent and were commissioned for this purpose by the Governments of India and Pakistan:—            </p>
            <p>  "On the morning of November 5, it was announced by beat of drum in Jammu city, in the name of 
              His Highness the Maharaja, that all Muslims must immediately leave the State and that, in fact, 
              Pakistan had asked for them. They were instructed to assemble at the parade ground in Jammu.
              Conducted from there to the police lines, they were searched, deprived of most of their belongings
              and loaded on motor lorry convoys. They were told they would be sent to Suchetgarh but instead the 
              convoys took the Kathua Road and halted at Mawa, where the passengers were told to get down.”
            
              "At Mawa, the lorry drivers, who were Sikhs and armed to the teeth, removed all the young women from the
              convoys and began to attack the remainder. The Kashmir State troops looked on indifferently while the mobs
              of Sikhs and Hindus were killing the Muslims.
              
              "Out of the four thousand Muslims, who had left Jammu, only nine hundred managed to reach Sialkot, in Pakistan. </p>
              <b>The massacre of Muslims of Jammu City 6, November 1947              </b>
          <p>  "A convoy of seventy trucks, containing most of the respectable Muslim families of Jammu city 
            left for Suchetgarh on November 6. A few miles out of the city, the trucks were halted and were
            attacked by armed jathas of Sikhs and State troops and volunteers of the Rashtrya Swayam Sewak Sangh. </p>
