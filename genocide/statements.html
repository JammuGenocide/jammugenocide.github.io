        <h4>Background & Intent of the genocide</h4>
        <br>
          <p style="text-align:left"><b>H</b>ari Singh and the Congress leadership knew that the majority of
          the State's populace was inclined to link its future with Pakistan; the
          Hari Singh's own preference, however, was that the State should remain
          independent or accede to India.
          <br><br>
          Sensing Hari Singh's intentions, the
          State's Muslim majority started organizing resistance forces in the border
          districts, particularly in Poonch. In order to maintain his stranglehold, Hari Singh initiated systematic tyranny and torture against the resistance
          movement. His aim was to spread fear and panic, not only to deter people
          from resisting his forces, but also to compel them into an exodus to
          Pakistan so that the demographic hurdle of the State's Muslim majority
          could be removed altogether.

          <br><br>
          
          Hari Singh invited the Rashtriya Sevak Singh (RSS), and the organized Sikh groups of extremists from East
          Punjab. These circumstances compelled a large number of the local Muslims to migrate to Pakistan. According to the official figures, they
          currently make up around 1.5 million in Pakistan's population alone.

          Wazarat, Jia Lal Darbari A.S.P. and Manohar Lal S.I. Police played an active
          role in organising a militia company headed by Capt. Kishan Singh, Capt.
          Omkar Singh of Bijepur and retired Zaildar of Biddha. The Sangh at Katra
          was assisted by the party of lnder Singh Namdar of the Militia company.
          Reasi sustained the highest percentage of ~OSS of life. The illaqa towards the
          right bank of the Chenab was somehow saved because Muslims received
          timely information and the Arnas people ran up towards the Gool side, some
          of whom made their way towards Rajauri and then to Pakistan and some
          slipped away towards the adjoining Kashmir territory. All the Government
          employees were killed. Permanand Naib tehsildar Arnas (Gool) was
          instrumental in blocking the roads leading to Gool. Pauni town was also
          raided and the Sanghis went up to Paurakotla.</p>

                 Bhasin said, the Maharaja’s administration helped <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> “even armed the communal marauders”.
          
                 Bhasin reported how several Muslims living outside Muslim-dominated areas were brutally killed <span class="hljs-keyword">by</span> the

                 “The curfew it appeared was meant only <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> check the movement <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> Muslims,” he said.
