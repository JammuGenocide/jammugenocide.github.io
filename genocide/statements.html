        <h4>Background & Intent of the genocide</h4>
        <br>
          <p style="text-align:left"><b>H</b>ari Singh and the Congress leadership knew that the majority of
          the State's populace was inclined to link its future with Pakistan; the
          Hari Singh's own preference, however, was that the State should remain
          independent or accede to India.
          <br><br>
          Sensing Hari Singh's intentions, the
          State's Muslim majority started organizing resistance forces in the border
          districts, particularly in Poonch. In order to maintain his stranglehold, Hari Singh initiated systematic tyranny and torture against the resistance
          movement. His aim was to spread fear and panic, not only to deter people
          from resisting his forces, but also to compel them into an exodus to
          Pakistan so that the demographic hurdle of the State's Muslim majority
          could be removed altogether.

          <br><br>
          
          Hari Singh invited the Rashtriya Sevak Singh (RSS), and the organized Sikh groups of extremists from East
          Punjab. These circumstances compelled a large number of the local Muslims to migrate to Pakistan. According to the official figures, they
          currently make up around 1.5 million in Pakistan's population alone.
