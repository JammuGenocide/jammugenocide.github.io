          <h2>Precursors to the Genocide</h2>
          <p><span>Such a climate of fear and uncertainty, by April 1947,
            non-Muslims from the violence in the Rawalpindi division were
            arriving in other parts of the Punjab and the Kashmir region,
            expecting to return after the violence ceased. With in a week of
            the killings, <b>'a large flock'</b> of the Hindus and Sikhs from
            Rawalpindi division started migrating to neighbouring Kashmir
            region. The embittered Sikh and Hindu refugees' tales of
            violence raised animosities wherever they settled. They planned
            revenge and produced and circulated wildly inflammatory
            pamphlets and brochures.</span> <br><br>

            At the time also the Dogra Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh's
            own preference was that the State should remain independent or
            accede to India, knowing that majority of the State's populace
            was inclined to link its future with Pakistan. In order to maintain
            his stranglehold, the Maharaja had initiated systematic tyrannical
            campaign against the <b>'dissenters'</b> as early as the outset of May. <br><br>

          <h2>Catalysts for the Genocide</h2>
          <p>By the mid-August, the state administration had not only
            demobilised a large number of Muslim soldiers serving in the
            state army but also the Muslim police officers, whose loyalty
            was suspected, had also been sent home. The State's Muslim
            majority contagious to the Punjab, particularly in Poonch, started
            organizing resistance forces in the border districts, There were
            regular reports of <b>'persecutions'</b> and <b>'mass murders of Muslims
            in Poonch'</b>. The violence sparked off an exodus and Muslim
            refugees flowed in the opposite direction. A large number of
            Kashmiri Muslim families from Poonch started pouring into the
            border districts of Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Gujrat and Sialkot. 
            <br><br>
            
            The refugees related harrowing tales of massacres by the state Dogra
            troopers. This image of Kashmir inflamed the Punjabi Muslims
            and, in particular stirred up the movement of tribes of NorthWest Frontier Province.
            The Muslim Pukhtoon tribes of North-West Frontier
            Province stirred up the movement and declared a <b>'jihad'</b>. The
            raiders who numbered about 20,000 crossed the border and
            smuggled arms into Kashmir. They, along with the Muslim army
            deserters from the state forces and retired army men, came to
            help rouse the peasantry of Poonch. Indeed around 60,000
            Poonchis and other <b>'hill men'</b> had served in the British Indian
            Army during the Second World War. </p>

          <h2>Genocide of Muslims begins</h2>
          <p>On 26 October the Maharaja fled from Srinagar to
            Jammu as the threat of <b>'liberation'</b> armed activists poised to
            capture the city. The situation was much the same in Jammu. The danger for
            Muslims multiplied <b>'every hour'</b> as hordes of Hindu and Sikh
            refugees started pouring into Jammu from areas that were going
            to become Pakistan. In April, the first trickle of refugees had
            already arrived in Jammu followed the March 1947 violence in
            Punjab Rawalpindi, Attock, Murree, Bannu and Hazara. The
            daily flood peaked in late 1947 when an estimated 160,000
            population of Hindus and Sikhs migrated from the western
            districts of Pakistan. By that time, majority of the non-Muslim
            population of Sialkot had fled to Jammu during the partitionrelated 
            disturbances. Sialkot and Jammu were nothing less than
            twin cities. The north-eastern part of Sialkot was principally
            inhabited by the Dogras inhabitants. They were closely linked
            culturally and linguistically with the Hindu Dogras of Gurdaspur
            on the one side and Jammu on the other. As the Punjab boundary
            award was announced and the disturbances worsened, about
            100,000 Hindu and Sikh refugees from Sialkot migrated to
            Jammu. <br><br>


            In Jammu city alone, by mid- September, they numbered
            65,000. Their arrival brought the communal tension to <b>'the
            breaking point'</b>. They carried with them harrowing stories of
            Muslim atrocity, which were retold in the press and given
            official sanction by the state media. For example, a Jammu based
            Hindu paper boasted that <b>'a Dogra can kill at least two hundred
            Muslims'</b> which illustrated the communal level to which the  media and parties had sunk.
             This further intensified the Muslim
            killings and exodus. Almost immediately, the disgruntled Dogra
            refugees backed by their relatives from Jammu started a general
            clearing of the Muslim population. They were provided arms and
            ammunition by the state officials. Sikh deserters of the Sialkot
            Unit, who migrated in Jammu and also had taken away with
            themselves rifles and ammunition now utilised them.25 The daily
            Telegraph of London journalist reported on 12 January 1948:
            'Yet another element in the situation is provided by Sikh
            refugees from the West Punjab who have sized Muslim lands in
            Jammuâ€¦ they originated the massacres there last October to
            clear for themselves new Sikh territory to compensate for their
            losses in Pakistan and to provide part of the nucleus of a future
            Sikhistan'. </p>

          <h2>Aftermath & impact of the Jammu Genocide</h2>
          <img src="../images/peshawar_immigrants.jpeg" width="100%"> <br><br>
          <p>            
            The level of destruction was worst in Jammu city where
            Muslims were in minority. Their concentration was in <b>Ustad da
            Mohalla, Pthanan da Mohalla and Khalka Mohalla</b>. The latter
            was much larger than the other two combined. These Muslim
            localities presented a picture of destruction by mid-September
            1947. Hundreds of Gujars were massacred in mohalla Ram
            Nagar. Village Raipur, within Jammu cantonment area was burnt
            down. The killings and dispersal of the Muslims from Jammu city
            were a clear example of the ethnic cleansing of a locality. By mid September, Jammu 
            city's Muslim population was
            halved. By late November, hundred of thousands Kashmiri
            refugees had arrived in the border towns of Sialkot, Gujrat and
            Jhelum. <br><br>

            The Dogra state troops were at the forefront of attacks on
            Muslims. The state authorities were also reported to be issuing
            arms not only to local volunteer organizations such as RSS, but
            to those in surrounding East Punjab districts such as Gurdaspur.
            G. K. Reddy, a Hindu editor of the Kashmir Times said in a
            statement published in the daily Nawa-i-Waqt, <b>'I saw the armed
            mob with the complicity of Dogra troops was killing the
            Muslims ruthlessly. The state officials were openly giving out
            weapons to the mob'</b>. The state administration had not only
            demobilised a large number of Muslim soldiers serving in the
            state army, but Muslim police officers, whose loyalty was
            suspected, had also been sent home. In Jammu city, the Muslim
            military were disarmed and the Jammu cantonment Brigadier
            Khoda Box replaced by a Hindu Dogra officer. There were also
            reports that the Maharaja of Patiala was not only supplying
            weapons, but also a Sikh Brigade of Patiala State troops were
            also operating in Jammu and Kashmir. The state authorities
            intended to create a Hindu majority in the Jammu region. The
            Dogra troopers ejected the entire population of Muslims of Dulat
            Chak on 28 November, claiming it was a part of the state. The
            troops of a Sikh Brigade raided the bordering villages and forced
            the Muslims there to evacuate and go beyond the old Ujh river
            bed.The daily Times of London reported the events in Jammu
            with such a front page headings: <b>'Elimination of Muslims from
            Jammu'</b> and pointed out that the Maharaja Hari Singh was 'in
            person commanding all the forces' which were ethnically
            cleansing the Muslims. <br></br>

            After the closure of Sialkot-Jammu railway line, the
            Muslims started concentrating in a camp from isolated pockets to
            the large enclaves within the Jammu Police Lines. They sought
            assistance from the Pakistan government to take immediate steps
            to ensure their safety. In the first week of November, the
            Pakistan government despatched many buses to Jammu city to
            transport the refugees into Sialkot. When the convoy arrived at
            Jammu-Sialkot road, Dogra troopers, RSS men and many armed
            Sikhs attacked the caravan and killed most of the passengers and
            abducted their women. <br><br>
